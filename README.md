# What's Deadliner?
Deadliner is a cross-platform desktop application for setting deadline for a project and keeping track of the time left by dynamically updating the wallpaper of your desktop with the time left so that you're always reminded with your deadline and how much time is left and hopefully can help you stop procrastinating like me.

[See the landing page for more details](https://deadliner.vercel.app/)

# Why?

So, I was researching on “what makes someone productive?” for the 731th time! And surprisingly I found it in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzdGhVzQmJ8) from [Jonas Tyroller](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonasTyroller) - Indie game developer.

I like to take inspiration from game developers cause in my opinion they're the most  motivated/inspiring developers 😊.

This video was about asking successful game developers on how they think about productivity and the results were ***fascinating***, they all agreed on ***`Deadlines`*** as the most effective solution for procrastination.

I’ve always avoided deadlines in my side projects as they’re usually for learning purposes cause 
I thought setting deadlines will make me rush through the project and skip learning important details.

And so I said to myself: “Hey, let’s test this technique on my current side project(lightning-fast markdown parser), that can also improve my deadlines’ estimations a bit.”

Then I set a 14-days deadline, I immediately started to feel the difference on the first 2-4 days, after that I started to forget about how much time is left, so I wake up and say: “Hey, let’s watch a YT video and get to work after that, not a big deal right?”, plot twist: Yes, it was a big deal. The way you start your day has a huge impact on how the rest of it will go.

So I searched for desktop apps for setting deadlines and keeping track of it and what I found was that most of them share the same issues:

- Limited customizations
- I’ve to start it whenever I boot up my OS
- Lots of super annoying notifications for the remaining time
- Uses kind of a lot of resources in the background

So, that was a sign for a good Rust 🦀 project that aims for solving these issues 💪.
