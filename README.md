# What's Deadliner?
Deadliner is a cross-platform desktop application for setting deadline for a project and keeping track of the time left by dynamically updating the wallpaper of your desktop with the time left so that you're always reminded with your deadline and how much time is left and hopefully can help you stop procrastinating like me.

# Why deadlines specifically?

I like to take inspiration from game devs cause in my opinion they're the most motivated/inspiring developers.

When you ask any successful game dev about how does he stay productive even though he knows that he'll probably spend the next 4-10 years of his life developing his game, "how do you eliminate **procrastination**"?

And the answer always points to **setting deadlines** as the most effective *magical* solution.
